Code Quality
Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of:

https://github.com/chompasina/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L70-L88

Why were you proud of this piece of code? 

* I'm proud of this code because it encompasses a few ideas that I hadn't felt familiar with before this project -- event listeners, especially identifying a particular key that is pressed; blur on clicking away; and clearing the selection afterwards. 

Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

* https://github.com/chompasina/ideabox/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/ideas.js#L33-L52

Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

* This code felt hacky to me, rendering HTML into the JS function. In trying to refactor it, I wasn't sure how I could possibly add it into my HTML file instead. 

Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
